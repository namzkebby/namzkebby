				An <strong>octopus</strong> (pl: octopuses or <em>octopodes,</em> see below for variants) is a soft-bodied, eight-limbed <i>mollusc</i> of the order <i>Octopoda</i> (/ɒkˈtɒpədə/, ok-TOP-ə-də[3]). The order consists of some <strong>300</strong> <i>species</i> and is grouped within the class <strong>Cephalopoda</strong> with squids, cuttlefish, and nautiloids. Like other cephalopods, an octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a <em>beaked</em> mouth at the center point of the eight limbs.[a] The soft body can radically alter its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze through small gaps. They trail their eight appendages behind them as they swim. The <i>siphon</i> is used both for respiration and for locomotion, by expelling a jet of water. Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the most <strong>intelligent</strong> and <strong>behaviourally</strong> diverse of all invertebrates.

				Octopuses inhabit various regions of the <em>ocean,</em> including <em>coral reefs, pelagic waters,</em> and the <em>seabed;</em> some live in the <i>intertidal zone</i> and others at <i>abyssal</i> depths. Most species grow quickly, mature early, and are short-lived. In most species, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes <em>senescent</em> and dies, while the female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies. Strategies to defend themselves against predators include the expulsion of <em>ink,</em> the use of <em>camouflage</em> and threat displays, the ability to jet quickly through the water and hide, and even deceit. All octopuses are <strong>venomous,</strong? but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to be <strong>deadly</strong> to humans.

				<br>
				Octopuses appear in <em>mythology</em> as sea <i>monsters</i> like the <strong>Kraken</strong> of Norway and the <strong>Akkorokamui</strong> of the Ainu, and probably the <strong>Gorgon</strong> of ancient Greece. A battle with an octopus appears in <b class="person">Victor Hugo</b>'s book <cite>Toilers of the Sea,</cite> inspiring other works such as <b class="person">Ian Fleming</b>'s <cite>Octopussy</cite>. Octopuses appear in Japanese erotic art, <strong>shunga</strong>. They are eaten and considered a delicacy by humans in many parts of the world, especially the <strong>Mediterranean</strong> and the <strong>Asian seas</strong>.
